Question is mind:
1)Does python have an enums ? why we need at first place
yes

Learning:
1)Whenever we have a group of constants under a same umbrella we can declare an enum with those set of constants
2)We can also have methods, variables, constructor inside enum, we can use it to make enumerated data types
3)Every constant in enum is a static final object of enum type

Why we went to final and string discussion becuase we had a read that we cannot have child enums as constants in a enum becuase enum constants are final
points:
4)Declaring a class final means you dont want anyone to change it, you want a fix set of immmutable behaviour so you declare it as final
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/final.html
5)Strings are immutable to make efficient use of memory by using string constant pool which has multiple references pointing to one String Object

6)enums extend to java.lang.Enum so they cannot extend any other class but they can implement interfaces
7)enum constructors are public, why?
cause they are not explicitly called, they are invoked for each and every constant declaration so it is not exposed to users to call it.
8)enum cannot have abstract methods since we cannot create a child enum which implements it as it is already extending to java.lang.ENUM
9)Even a class cannot extend an enum because it is like a final class(Having a private constructor so cannot be invoked in subclass by super())
